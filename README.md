# Apartment price prediction

The dataset that is used in this notebook contains information about apartments for sale in the city of Novi Sad and the surrounding area. The data was scraped on May 28, 2023 and I cleaned the data immediately after scraping it, so the data cleaning part is already done. The aim of this notebook is to first visualize the data and then apply regression models on dataset and predict the price of the apartment. The models used are Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost Regressor.
